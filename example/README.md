# Example for Maplibre Collision Boxes

A simple [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) app to demonstrate `maplibre-collision-boxes`.
This project was generated with `npm init vue@latest`.

This app shows a [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org) map around Tokyo Station, and randomly spreads cat and dog symbols.
You can click a cat or dog symbol and see which symbols are hidden by it.
